# React Native Uninitialized State Property Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where a component attempts to access a property of a state variable before the state has been properly initialized.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API.

The `Bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `BugSolution.js` file presents the corrected implementation.

**Problem:** Attempting to access a property of a state object before the state has been populated, leading to a runtime error. 

**Solution:** Implementing conditional rendering or providing default values to handle cases where the state is still uninitialized.
